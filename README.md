Project 0: Search

PUrpose of this project is to make a site that can utilize Google's search engine. 

The user will provide a search query and the site will redirect to the given part of Google. 
index.html functions as a basic Google search. I'm feeling lucky button will redirect to first result of query

imageSearch will redirect to image results of given query

advancedSearch will provide the user with advanced search options
    Find pages with… “all these words:”
    Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
    Find pages with… “any of these words:”
    Find pages with… “none of these words:”

CSS will mimic google's styling
Each page will have redirect links in the upper right. 
index provides options for both image and advanced, where the latter 2 will redirect back to search.
